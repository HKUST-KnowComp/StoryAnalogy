# StoryAnalogy: Deriving Story-level Analogies from Large Language Models to Unlock Analogical Understanding.

This is the official repo for the paper **StoryAnalogy: Deriving Story-level Analogies from Large Language Models to Unlock Analogical Understanding** [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12874) [[Poster]](raw/Poster%20-%20StoryAnalogy%20Deriving%20Story-level%20Analogies%20from%20Large%20Language%20Models%20to%20Unlock%20Analogical%20Understanding.pdf). 

<!-- In this work, we built a story level analogy dataset (**StoryAnalogy**), which could be accessed at `src/data`. -->

## Reproduce the results

We are currently actively preparing the presentation materials and will update the code shortly.

TODO-list

- Reframe the dataset with huggingface datasets and present a dataset card.
- Organize & release code for the experiments.
- A quick-start demo.
